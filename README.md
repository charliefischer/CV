#### Attention to detail

Working as a freelance illustrator on large crowd scenes I had to ensure the highest attention to detail for every aspect of the image. Within the madness of the scenes I still had to ensure every character looked how I or the client wanted, make sure every colour matches the clients house style, ensure formatting of the design was spot on and making sure files were fit for purpose whether it was going to be displayed on a phone or a 4 metre tall window display. 

#### Creativity

Creativity is a big part of my life and allows me think differently to the norm. Coming up with new solutions to clients needs excites me as well as in my life I'm always thinking how something could be changed to better it for looks as well as purpose.

#### Problem Solving

I love the challenge of solving problems whether it's in coding or day to day life. I love adding to my repetoire as I learn new things to solve problems that aren't initially obvious - whether it's in developing a game or building a chair out of some reclaimed wood.
